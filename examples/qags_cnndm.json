Palace have won six out of 10 league games since pardew succeeded neil warnock at the start of the year to all but guarantee their place in the premier league next season . The eagles were in the bottom three when pardew took over and their climb up the table has succeeded in easing relegation fears and subsequently boosting the profile of a manager who has yet to take charge of a club constantly vying for honours . Crystal palace boss alan pardew believes he has the ability to manage one of england 's top sides . Pardew , pictured with arsene wenger , feels he could do a better job than some of his rival managers . Pardew harbours no thoughts of leaving palace in the near future , but maintains he would acquit himself better than some of the managers currently employed by the premier league 's trophy - chasing sides . ' I look at the top teams and feel i could do that job better than i 'm seeing it being done , ' pardew told bbc radio 5 live 's sportsweek programme . ` but i 'm quite happy where i am and if i work in this part of the league for the rest of my career i will be extremely happy . ` i 'm really happy here - i do n't really want another job , ' he added . ` in a way the ( palace ) board have been lucky because even if i have great success here i wo n't be looking to jump away .

The key takeaway from the latest assessment of north korea 's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads , but the type of warhead , as this gives a better clue to the future of the country 's weapons capabilities .

The big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that north korea could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons - grade uranium . If that assessment is correct , and pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly - enriched weapons - grade uranium , then the plutonium program that the u.

I 've got a long way to go still . ' The spotlight belonged to spieth , who could break tiger woods ' 1997 tournament record of 18 - under 270 by shooting 69 in the final round . The former world number one woods started the day some shots back , and caused concern on the 7th hole when he seemed to injure his finger . He then pulled up on the 8th tee , shaking off the same hand while his girlfriend lindsey vonn watched from the crowds . If he wins , spieth would become the second - youngest winner in masters history , five months older than woods when he won his first major in 1997 .

A lifetime of following spurs can have that effect on you , especially in recent years . Last saturday 's inept capitulation to aston villa was the most recent occasion : a soft goal down after 45 minutes and an expensively assembled team which looked as if it had been recruited from the local jobcentre half an hour before the kick - off . Stephen dodd took this photograph of asif bodi and abubakar bhula praying at anfield last month . Had i actually gone through with it , however , within seconds i 'd have been hauled to my feet by the stewards and steered unceremoniously towards the exit . They are especially vigilant when it comes to anyone blocking the gangways or stairwells . And given football 's tragic history , from ibrox to hillsborough , their caution is well - merited . So it was surprising , to say the least , to see that photograph of two muslim liverpool supporters praying to mecca at half - time in an fa cup match . They had rolled out their prayer mat at the foot of some stairs beneath the stand , apparently with the full consent of safety staff . One of the men , solicitor asif bodi , 46 , from preston , explained that because the televised game did n't kick off until 4pm , the final whistle would have blown too late for them to pray outside the ground .

A lifetime of following spurs can have that effect on you , especially in recent years . Last saturday 's inept capitulation to aston villa was the most recent occasion : a soft goal down after 45 minutes and an expensively assembled team which looked as if it had been recruited from the local jobcentre half an hour before the kick - off . Stephen dodd took this photograph of asif bodi and abubakar bhula praying at anfield last month . Had i actually gone through with it , however , within seconds i 'd have been hauled to my feet by the stewards and steered unceremoniously towards the exit . They are especially vigilant when it comes to anyone blocking the gangways or stairwells . And given football 's tragic history , from ibrox to hillsborough , their caution is well - merited .

He is accused of horrific sexual attacks on seven children , both boys and girls . His youngest alleged victim is five years old . All of them were age 12 or younger . Detectives say he tempted them with video games , candy and trips to mcdonald 's . He also drove young children to his ` hideout ' in the woods where he allegedly forced them to perform sexual acts on him and raped them . Parents even let their children sleep over at his apartment .

        "source": "How neanderthals met their demise remains a long standing mystery for historians . One theory is that early modern humans ` bullied ' their neanderthal cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive . But a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by neanderthals . The researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the early ahmarian culture and the protoaurignacian culture , living in south and west europe and west asia around 40 , 000 years ago . They found the human tools ( pictured ) were no more effective than neanderthal - created tools of the same era . Researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought . Traditionally , scientists believed that innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of africa to europe . But the new study by nagoya university and the university of tokyo in japan argues neanderthals were just as well - equipped as their human counterparts . ` we 're not so special , i do n't think we survived neanderthals simply because of technological competence , ' said dr seiji kadowaki , first author of the study from nagoya university , japan . On the left is a map of the levant showing the locations of the early ahmarian - related sites analysed in this study .

        "reference": "How neanderthals met their demise remains a long standing mystery for historians . One theory is that early modern humans ` bullied ' their neanderthal cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive . But a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by neanderthals . The researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the early ahmarian culture and the protoaurignacian culture , living in south and west europe and west asia around 40 , 000 years ago . They found the human tools ( pictured ) were no more effective than neanderthal - created tools of the same era . Researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought . Traditionally , scientists believed that innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of africa to europe .
