### ü§î What is DCR-Consistency
DCR-Consistency is a novel framework that uses LLM agents to detect and mitigate inconsistencies, or in other words hallucinations. It takes advantage of LLM's power in semantic understanding while circumventing known pitfalls such as relatively poor performance in math. For more details please see [our paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WcGXAxhC81).

Given a `reference` as the ground truth and a `candidate` to evaluate, it will output a numeric score between [0, 1] indicating its consistency where 0 means no sentence in the `candidate` is consistent and 1 otherwise. It also outputs a list of `reasons` about why this score is generated. Better yet, based on such `reasons`, it can improve the `candidate` and mitigate detected inconsistencies.

It composes of three parts:

* DCE takes a `reference` and a `candidate`, evaluates the consistency between the two on a sentence level, and outputs a list of `reasons` on the consistency check for each sentence in the `candidate`.
* AMC takes the output of DCE and convert it to a numeric score between [0, 1]
* RAI takes the `reasons` output of DCE and generates improved versions that mitigate detected inconsistencies.

### üòã How well does DCR-Consistency work?
We evaluated DCR-Consistency framework on a wide range of datasets: QQP, PAWS-QQP, SummEval, QAGS-CNN, QAGS-XSUM.

Below is a comparison of DCR-Consistency with some start of art metrics on SummEval dataset about consistency. We included prestigious metrics like BERTScore, and trending new ones leveraging LLMs(GPT-3.5/4) such as G-Eval as well. DCR-Consistency is outperforming those metrics with a large margin.

We also evaluated DCR-Consistency's effectiveness on inconsistency migration. Below is a illustration showing the consistency rate changes after iterations of applying DCR-Consistency. We observe effective mitigations in all three datasets and that 100% migration of detected inconsistency can be achieved within three rounds.

### ü§ñ Installation

* Ensure you have python >= 3.9
* Clone this repo and install with

```
pip install . 
```

DCR-Consistency can also be installed directly from pip(coming soon!)
```
pip install dcr-consistency
```

### üöÄ Quickstart
The easiest way to start is to play with the example in `examples/example.py`. To do so:

* Install the DCR-Consistency package with steps above
* Install the necessary packages with command below (example use additional dependencies such as openai):
```
pip install -r examples/requirements_example.txt
```
* update the `api_key` variable with your apikey.
* run the example with
```
python examples/example.py
```


### üìÉ Usage
#### Evaluation
```
res = evaluate(_your_LLM_, _your_model_config_, data, worker_count=5)
```

* **_your_LLM_**: This will be your own object that handles communication with LLM. It should follow the contract of [LLM](https://github.com/intuit-ai-research/DCR-consistency/blob/main/dcr/components/llm.py) abstract class. This allows freedom of using whatever LLM you desire. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/intuit-ai-research/DCR-consistency/blob/716a802d58e92b4f0ce5f9e5303bb713737d3676/examples/example.py#L11)
* **_your_model_config_**: This will be whatever parameter your LLM needs. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/intuit-ai-research/DCR-consistency/blob/716a802d58e92b4f0ce5f9e5303bb713737d3676/examples/example.py#L32)
* **worker_count**: This configures the number of threads to run the program
* **data**: The `data` filed will be a list of data to run. By default each item in it should be a dict containing fields `id`, `reference` and `candidate`. The returned item will be the original data passed in joined with the columns below:

| column  | meaning   |
|-------------|:------------|
|  id | Unique Identifier for each row | 
|  score | Final consistency score of the row | 
| dce_reasons | Reasons for the final score given by DCE| 
| amc_reasons | Reasons for scoring of each sentence given by AMC | 
|  dce_raw | Raw data from DCE | 
| amc_raw | Raw data from AMC | 
|  decision | Consistency decision based on DCE | 

#### Inconsistency Mitigation
```
res = improve(_your_LLM_, _your_model_config_, data, worker_count=5)
```

* **_your_LLM_**: This will be your own object that handles communication with LLM. It should follow the contract of [LLM](https://github.com/intuit-ai-research/DCR-consistency/blob/main/dcr/components/llm.py) abstract class. This allows freedom of using whatever LLM you desire. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/intuit-ai-research/DCR-consistency/blob/716a802d58e92b4f0ce5f9e5303bb713737d3676/examples/example.py#L11)
* **_your_model_config_**: This will be whatever parameter your LLM needs. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/intuit-ai-research/DCR-consistency/blob/716a802d58e92b4f0ce5f9e5303bb713737d3676/examples/example.py#L32)
* **worker_count**: This configures the number of threads to run the program
* **data**: The `data` filed will be a list of data to run. By default each item in it should be a dict containing fields `id`, `article` and `sentences`. `article` is the `reference` passed into evaluator. `sentences` can be extracted from the output evaluator. It is a list holding information on what the original sentences are and whether each sentence is or is not consistent compared to the reference and the reasons. The returned item will be the original data passed in joined with the columns below:

| column  | meaning   |
|-------------|:------------|
|  id | Unique Identifier for each row | 
|  improved_version | The improved version where inconsistency is mitigated | 
| rai_raw | Raw data from RAI|
